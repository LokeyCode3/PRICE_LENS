This project implements a GenAI-powered Price Change Explainability Bot focused on analyzing gold price movements under the PS-403 problem statement. Frequent gold price fluctuations often confuse traders and raise trust and compliance concerns when price changes are not transparent. This system translates complex pricing drivers into clear, plain-language explanations while grounding every claim in auditable market data such as demand signals, inventory changes, production costs, and broader market movements. The goal is to improve transparency and trust by making gold price changes understandable for both everyday users and regulatory or analytical audiences.

A core challenge addressed in this project is avoiding post-hoc storytelling. Every explanation generated by the bot is strictly aligned with the exact model features and time windows that caused a price change. Feature attribution is computed first, and only then converted into human-readable narratives. This ensures the explanations accurately reflect the real factors behind gold price movements rather than fabricated or generic reasoning.

The system generates multi-audience narratives for each price event. One version is designed for traders and consumers, providing a simple and intuitive explanation of why the gold price moved. Another version is built for regulators and analysts, offering a detailed breakdown with evidence pointers, feature impact values, time-window references, and confidence labels. All explanation versions are logged and versioned to ensure auditability, traceability, and compliance readiness.

To balance transparency with safety, the bot includes filters that prevent disclosure of sensitive trade secrets or proprietary pricing logic while remaining truthful about price drivers. Each explanation is tagged with a confidence level based on signal strength and data quality. The project is currently under active development, with future enhancements planned such as real-time gold market data ingestion, trading session-based context (Asia, London, New York), visual feature attribution, and automated alerts for unusual price movements.
